Prime numbers are fascinating, these numbers are only divisible by 1 and by themselves only. The easiest way to determine whether a number is prime is to take the nearest square number and try to divide the number in question with the smaller prime numbers than the square root of square number.

For example, to check out if 173 is a prime number, first we take the nearest square number which is 196 whose square root is 14. So we try to divide 173 by the smaller numbers than 14, which are 13, 11, 7, 5, 3 and 2. None of which divides 173 completely. Hence, we can announce that 173 is a prime number.
