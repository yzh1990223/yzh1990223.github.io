Do you know how frustrating it is to spend years taking the longer route of achieving a task, only to find out that there is actually a quicker and easier method of doing the same? Well, that is what i felt when i discovered the **“clear formatting”** button in the WordPress editor.

What the button does is to clear all formatting from external sources like Microsoft Word and iWork Pages etcetera. When you copy text from applications like Microsoft Word they carry specific formatting underneath and when you paste it into a WordPress editor and publish,the styling in your theme and from the copied text might clash, which might cause the webpage not to display as you want it to. The workaround I used to have is to switch to the _text_ mode from the _visual_ mode in the WordPress editor window and paste the text there. So the next time you face this situation simply click the clear formatting button and all the formatting will be gone.

I bet you didn’t know about this WordPress button.
