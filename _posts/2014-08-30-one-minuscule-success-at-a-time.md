Its been 12 days since I have joined a gym. I have never worked out in my life, or at least in the context of working out at a gym. The first day I went to workout, I felt like starting a 10K run when everybody else is either crossing the finish line or at least they are within 500 meters of the finish line. I worked hard, I curled dumbbells and barbells with every fiber of my body, I discovered muscles which I did not think I have in my body. Everything hurt, every exercise from side bends to bench press seemed seemed to require similar strength to move a mountain. But I kept going, I kept pressing harder and harder against all odds.

3 days in, I could not do anything else. I got a grade 1 pectoral strain and my trainer gave me a day off. On the 5th day, I realized I could not do the stuff I could do previously, like anaerobic exercises such as sit-ups and push-ups. I felt disheartened. But there was a silver lining. I was gaining strength in other areas. I could do _5 kilos_ press downs _(5 sets x 10)_ without any effort. Albeit it was a small win, it was a win nonetheless.

Today, in the 12 day mark, I still cannot do sit-ups and push-ups well, but everyday I am gaining some advantage in other categories. I have increased the weight in my barbell curl routine from no weight to _2.50 kilos_ to the current _5 kilos_. My dumbbells went from being half a kilo each to _3 kilos_ each. The strength in my pecs are tip-toeing back again, I can do _3 kilos_ dumbbell flies _4 sets x 10 times_. One small win yesterday, one small win today. These are what make me keep going, and keep the going strong.

I am counting on these small wins. These wins may look small, count as small and weigh even smaller on the weight scale(!), in the retrospect, these small wins are simply stacking up to make the bigger, more desirable win. I hope these small wins keep on coming, and keep coming at a bigger rate than ever before.
